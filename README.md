## **Synopsis**


Samâ€™s Pizza & More is a small pizza shop in Stockton that has served the community for about
ten years. They have many different flavors and toppings for customers to choose from. The shop features an extensive menu including fast food items such as burgers, and a variety of fried foods such as French fries, zucchini fries, chicken nuggets, cheese sticks, mini corn dogs, burrito fries, and more. They also offer rice bowls with chicken, beef, or pork.

Prior to now, Sam's Pizza did not have a website to allow potential customers to browse the menu and decide on if they wanted to go to the restaurant or not. While the client eventually decided agsint having online ordering functionality, an online menu for customers to reference will be useful in drawing attention to the store nonetheless.
